## MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern 🏗️ :

- 🎨 MVC is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces.
- 🔄 It divides the application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller.
- 💾 The model represents the data and business logic of the application.
- 🖥️ The view is responsible for displaying the data to the user.
- 🎮 The controller handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly

/// Repl : Read-Eval-Print-Loop
Its a simple interactive shell that evaluates user input and prints the result.
How it works :

- Run node command to run the repl
- 📝 The user types in a command and hits enter.
- 🔍 The REPL evaluates the command and returns the result.
- 🖨️ The result is printed to the console.

/// Payload : data that is sent from one endpoint to another.

/// Streams :

- 📤 A stream is a sequence of data that can be read or written in a continuous fashion.

/// Chunks :

- 📦 A chunk is a smallest unit / piece of data that is read or written from a stream.

/// Socket :

- 📡 A socket is a software abstraction that allows communication between two endpoints over a network.

/// Buffer :

- 📦 A buffer is a temporary storage area that is used to hold data that is being transferred between two endpoints.
- It does lots of things like : reordering of chunks/ packets, buffering, and splitting.

/// Pipe :

- 🚰 A pipe is a mechanism that allows data to be transferred between two endpoints.

/// HTTP :

- 📡 HTTP is a protocol that allows communication between a client and a server over the internet.
- 📡 It is a request-response protocol, where the client sends a request to the server and the server responds with a response.

/// HTTPS :

- 📡 HTTPS is a protocol that allows secure communication between a client and a server over the internet.
- 📡 It is a request-response protocol, where the client sends a request to the server and the server responds with a response.
- 📡 HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the data that is sent between the client and the server.

/// TCP :

- 📡 TCP is a protocol that allows lossless communication between two endpoints over the internet.
- 📡 It is a connection-oriented protocol, where the client and server establish a connection before communication begins.
- It is a reliable protocol, where the data is guaranteed to be delivered in the correct order.

/// UDP :

- 📡 UDP is a protocol that allows lossy communication between two endpoints over the internet.
- 📡 It is a connectionless protocol, where the client and server do not establish a connection before communication begins.
- It is a unreliable protocol, where the data may be lost or delivered in the wrong order.

/// WebSocket :

- 📡 A WebSocket is a protocol that allows full-duplex communication between a client and a server over the internet.
- 📡 It is a connection-oriented protocol, where the client and server establish a connection before communication begins.
- It is a reliable protocol, where the data is guaranteed to be delivered in the correct order.

/// Http Headers :

- 📡 Http headers are metadata that are sent with an HTTP request or response.
- 📡 They contain information about the request or response, such as the content type, the content length, and the cookies.
